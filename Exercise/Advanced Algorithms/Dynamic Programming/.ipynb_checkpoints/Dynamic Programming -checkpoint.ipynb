    "## Dynamic Programming Intro\n",
    "Sometimes we are presented a complex problem that seems too difficult to solve. Perhaps it requires so many numerical calculations that it could take days or years to finish them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some of these complex problems can be broken down into smaller, solvable, sub-problems. Then, once they're broken down, we can iterate through them via a recursive procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is induction. We solve the smallest case and then iterate through larger cases until we solve the original, complex, problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, this process is known as **dynamic programming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several classic problems that can be solved with dynamic programming. A few include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __The Backpack problem__ - Fitting items of various shapes, sizes, and value into a backpack to maximize profit.\n",
    "* __Egg dropping__ - Minimizing the number of trials needed to determine the height at which an egg will break, given that the maximum height is m stories and that you only have k eggs where k<m.\n",
    "* __Fibonacci numbers__ - Using dynamic programming to find and calculate Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a dynamic programming problem, you will generally follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort the data (if necessary) so that it lends itself to a dynamic approach.\n",
    "2. Solve for the simplest case, otherwise known as the trivial case. (Often n = 0and/or n = 1).\n",
    "3. Recognize patterns for small nn to see how they depend on smaller nn.\n",
    "4. Come up with a recursive way to derive all values based on values that come before them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a few examples and explore how to set them up for a dynamic approach.\n",

    "### Example 1.\n",
    "###### 1.\n",
    "Consider this general problem: We have a currency with different coin denominations and would like to minimize the total number of coins we would need to total $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, we have coins of denomination 1, 5, 7 and 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $m_n$ be the minimum number of coins needed to get to a total of exactly $n$. For example, the minimum number of coins required to total a value of 49 would be $m_{49}$ \n",
    "\t\n",
    "###### 1: What are $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$, $m_4$, and $m_5$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Correct answer: \n",
    "> 1,2,3,4,1\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, until you hit five you can only work with the coins of denomination 1. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_1$ = 1 coins of value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_2$ = 2 coins of value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_3$ = 3 coins of value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_4$ = 4 coins of value 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_n$ = n for $n<5$\n",
    "\n",
    "And when we hit 5, we can just use the coin of denomination 5, so $m_5$ = 1\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 2.\n",
    "Now, let's go back to finding the best way to make change for a value of 49.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume for now, we know all the values for $m_n$ when $n < 49$. Again, $m_n$ represents the minimum number of coins needed to add up to $n$. Using these, we will try to find the value of $m_49$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final goal is to find $m_{49}$ as a function of $m_1, m_2, ...,m_{48}$.  However, for now lets try making some simple statements about its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, given that one of our coins has a denomination of 1, what can we say about the relationship between $m_{49}$ and $m_{48}$? Try not to calculate $m_{49}$ and $m_{48}$, just think  about what the relationship between them might be if we have a coin worth one.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Correct answer: \n",
    "Since we have a one denomination coin, we know that a possible solution is to take the number of coins in $m_{48}$ and add 1 coin to it. So, we have an upper bound of $m_{48} + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that is the upper bound. As with the $m_4$ and $m_5$ example, for some $n$s we can achieve lower $m_n$ han their $m_{n-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, based only on the fact that we have one denomination coins we can say:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_{49} <= m_{48} + 1$\n",
    " \n",
    "This is because we can always add a one denomination coin to a pile containing \n",
    "$m_{48}$ coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can add a five denomination coin to a pile containing $m_{44}$ coins. Or we could add a seven denomination coin to a pile containing $m_{42}$ coins. Or finally, we could add an eleven denomination coin to a pile containing $m_{38}$ coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "his gives us the following relationships for the 1,5,7 and 11 denomination coins respectively:\n",
    "- $m_{49} <= m_{48} + 1$\n",
    "- $m_{49} <= m_{44} + 1$\n",
    "- $m_{49} <= m_{42} + 1$\n",
    "- $m_{49} <= m_{38} + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "###### 3.\n",
    "Let's see if we can come up with a general equation for $m_{49}$ as a function of all previous $m_n$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these statements and the fact that you can go from a value of 38, 42, 44 and 48 to a value of 49 by adding 1 coin, what do you suppose will be the expression for $m_{49}$ as a function of $m_n$ for $n < 49$\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Solution:\n",
    "The optimal solution for adding one coin that will give the minimum number of ways to get there, will be to consider all the possible coins that could have been added and add one to the minimum of that group, or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m_{49} = 1 + min(m_{48}, m_{44}, m_{42}, m_{38})$\n",
    "\n",
    "And, in fact we can generalize this to the recursive relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ${m_N = 1 + min(m_{N-1}, m_{N-5}, m_{N-7}, m_{N-11}) \\text{ for } N>11}$ \n",
